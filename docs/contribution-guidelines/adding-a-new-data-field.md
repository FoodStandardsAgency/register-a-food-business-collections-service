# Adding a new data field

In order to add anew data field it needs to be validated then added to the external connections.

## Steps:

1.  Add the data field to the database model in `db/models` in the correct subsection
2.  Create a new migration to add the data field column in the PostgresDB. For more information, see documentation on [Sequelize](https://sequelize.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/migrations/)
